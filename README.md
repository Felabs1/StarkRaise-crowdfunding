NFT Marketplace: Mint and trade project-backed NFTs on a decentralized marketplace.
Privacy and Security: Blockchain ensures data security and user privacy.

# Objectives

Promote transparency and fairness in funding processes.
Enable creators to monetize their projects effectively.
Enhance user engagement through incentivization.
